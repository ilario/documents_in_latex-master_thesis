\begin{section}{Further Studies}

Further studies will focus on the origin of the optical activity investigating the conformation of small aggregates and bulk solid via \gls{NMR} and probably solid state \gls{NMR}.  
Then we plan to study \cmpd+{sz17} to further confirm that it is a block copolymer rather than a blend of polymers. Then we could use \gls{CD} spectroscopy to study the formation of inverse micelles, this study can give useful information on the intra\-chain or inter\-chain origin of optical activity. 
Obviously we plan to test our diblock copolymer in solar cells active layer and to study improvements of \gls{PCBM} and nano\-crystals dispersion before and after an annealing process. We'll try to find a suitable matrix for the \gls{MALDI} analysis of both polythiophene and polyvinylpyridine, needed for the \gls{MALDI} characterization of the block copolymer.
